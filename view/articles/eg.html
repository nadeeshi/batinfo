Egyptian BatThough widespread in the eastern U.S., this bat is nowhere abundant and population levels appear to have declined in the past century due to loss of summer roosting or foraging habitat and/or disturbance at winter hibernacula. Rafinesque&rsquo;s big-eared bats are at special risk where they form nursery or hibernation colonies in caves that are susceptible to recreational disturbance and in abandoned mines slated for closure or reclamation.
