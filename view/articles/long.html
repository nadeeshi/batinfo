Long-Eared BatRafinesque&rsquo;s big-eared bats are known to form nursery colonies in large hollow trees. Hollow tree roosts provide stable internal environments, protection from predators, and often contain well-insulated areas that form the hot-air traps essential for rearing young. These bats range throughout the southeastern United States from southern Virginia south and west to eastern Texas and northward along the Mississippi River valley to southern Indiana. Their range most closely approximates the historical range of great cypress swamps, indicating that they may have formed a traditional reliance on these areas as roosting and/or foraging sites.
