Bats, Bats and more Bats. I did not expect this. None of the travel guides I had read before my visit to Sri Lanka mentioned the giant fruit bats that you could see flying above the Colombo skyline. The best place to view these monsters of the air is in Viharamahadevi Park which is positioned between the National Museum and the Colombo Town Hall.
They use the tall trees to roost. I had seen banana trees with bags over the fruit in an earlier part of my trip. I know know why. It is to protect the cash crop from being nibbled.
