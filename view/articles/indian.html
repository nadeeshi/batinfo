Indian BatAs much of these swamp-lands have been drained and trees have been harvested, these bats have apparently moved their maternity roosts into old buildings or attics. Rafinesque&rsquo;s big-eared bats are slow, agile flyers and appear to forage on a wide variety of small, nocturnal insects, especially moths. They hibernate near their summer foraging grounds in old mines, caves, and cisterns.
